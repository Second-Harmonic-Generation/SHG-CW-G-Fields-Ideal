## 1. About this repository

This repository contains the **Toolkit for Modeling of Second Harmonic Electric-Field Distribution in KTP Crystal: Continuous-Wave Gaussian Second Harmonic Generation**, an open-source toolkit for investigating the effect of temperature increase on the efficiency of second-harmonic generation (SHG) processes.

### Toolkit Overview

The toolkit implements a comprehensive depleted wave model that describes the continuous-wave SHG process with fundamental Gaussian waves in a double-pass cavity type II configuration. The model solves six coupled equations to generate the second harmonic of a Gaussian fundamental wave, accounting for fundamental beam depletion rather than using the conventional non-depleted assumption.

The toolkit models the critical effect of temperature increase in the nonlinear crystal due to optical absorption by incorporating mismatched phase arising from changes in refractive indices into the coupled equations. This approach enables the investigation of how SHG efficiency decreases when the crystal temperature increases by 5, 10, and 15 K, revealing dramatic reductions in efficiency due to small temperature changes.

The implementation features a homemade code written in Intel Fortran with compiled kernels, built-in benchmark reporting, and reproducible pipelines. The toolkit generates comprehensive datasets with spatiotemporal field distributions and efficiency analyses, showing excellent agreement with experimental data. This toolkit was used to solve the modeling problem described in the research article **"Temperature increase effects on a double-pass cavity type II second-harmonic generation: a model for depleted Gaussian continuous waves"**.
