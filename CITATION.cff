abstract: >
  We model continuous-wave type-II SHG in a double-pass cavity with Gaussian beams,
  solving six coupled depleted-wave equations and incorporating thermally induced
  phase mismatch from absorption-driven temperature rise in the nonlinear crystal.
  A finite-difference FORTRAN implementation quantifies efficiency versus power,
  spot size, crystal length, and Î”T, showing sharp efficiency losses even for small
  temperature increases and good agreement with prior experimental data.
